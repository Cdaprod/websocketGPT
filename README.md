# WebSocket server using ChatGPT API

This project contains a WebSocket server that uses the OpenAI ChatGPT API to generate responses to text prompts. The server listens on port 8000 and responds to incoming WebSocket connections with responses generated by the ChatGPT API.

## Prerequisites

To use this server, you will need an OpenAI API key. If you don't have one, sign up for one on the OpenAI website.

## Usage

To use the server, first, create a .env file with your API key:


```
API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
``` 

Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual OpenAI API key.

Then, build and run the Docker container using the following commands:

``` 
docker build --build-arg API_KEY=$(grep API_KEY .env | cut -d '=' -f2) -t ws_chatgpt .
docker run -p 8000:8000 ws_chatgpt
These commands build the Docker image using the API key from the .env file and run the WebSocket server on port 8000.
``` 

Once the server is running, you can connect to it using a WebSocket client and send text prompts. The server will respond with generated responses from the ChatGPT API.
